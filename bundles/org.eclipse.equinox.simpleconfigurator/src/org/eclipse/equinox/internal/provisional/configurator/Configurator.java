/**
 * The implementation of this interface will be registered into a service registry
 * by a Configurator Bundle.
 *
 * The client bundle can apply configuration which can be interpreted by referring
 * the specified location to the current running OSGi environment. In addition,
 * the client can expect bundle state in advance .
 *
 * TODO: this interface might not be required to be defined.
 *
 *
 * **********************************************
 * Current Definition of Configurator Bundle:
 *
 * Configurator Bundle will do the following operation at its startup.
 *
 * 1. Create a Configurator object.
 * 2. Register it as a service to the service registry.
 * 3. Get where to read for knowing what kinds of bundles in its implementation dependent way.
 * 4. Call {@link Configurator#applyConfiguration(URL)} with the URL.
 *
 * At its stopping, the service registered will be unregistered.
