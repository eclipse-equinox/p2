/**
 * A manipulator is used to query and modify the state of a framework instance.
 * A manipulator instance is obtained by calling {@link FrameworkAdmin#getManipulator()}.
 *
 * The typical use-cases of this interface:
 *
 * Usecase 1: set parameters, check the expected state, save them into configuration files, and launch.
 * 	A. create a {@link Manipulator} object from a {@link FrameworkAdmin}.
 *  B. set parameters to the {@link Manipulator} object.
 *  C. getExpectedState() and check what bundle state will be realized.
 *     If it is not same as you desire, repeat B and C until it becomes as you desire.
 *  D. save parameters into configuration files by {@link Manipulator#save(boolean)}.
 *  E. launch the framework by {@link FrameworkAdmin#launch(Manipulator, File)}.
 *
 * Usecase 2: set parameters required for loading, load parameters from configuration files,
 * 		  check the expected state, and launch.
 * 	A. create a {@link Manipulator} object from a {@link FrameworkAdmin}.
 *  B. set parameters about launcher or framework configuration file to the {@link Manipulator} object.
 *  C. load parameters from configuration files by {@link Manipulator#load()};
 *  D. getExpectedState() and check what bundle state will be realized.
 *  E. launch the framework by {@link FrameworkAdmin#launch(Manipulator, File)}.
