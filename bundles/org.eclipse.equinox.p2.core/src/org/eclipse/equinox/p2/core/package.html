Provides core support for interacting with a p2-based provisioning system
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package specifies API for creating, using, and extending a provisioning system.
A provisioning agent ties together a set of related services that work together
to implement a provisioning system. For end users of the provisioning system,
they simply instantiate or obtain an agent and get the services they require from
the agent. Extenders can register a factory for adding new services to the system,
or add services directly to an agent.
</p>
<p>
This package also provides some basic utility classes that are common across large
parts of the system.
