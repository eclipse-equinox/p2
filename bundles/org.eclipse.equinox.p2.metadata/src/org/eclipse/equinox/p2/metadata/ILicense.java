 * The <code>ILicense</code> interface represents a software license.  A license has required body text

 * Licenses can be added to arbitrary installable units, and will typically be displayed to
 * end users and require explicit agreement before installation proceeds.

 * Instances of this class are handle objects and do not necessarily
 * reflect entities that exist in any particular profile or repository. These handle
 * objects can be created using {@link MetadataFactory}.
