 * The root interface for all queries that can be performed on an {@link IQueryable}.

 * <p>
 * Any given query must be stable - running the same query on the same inputs
 * must return an equal query result each time the query is executed. Thus a client
 * that has performed a query can freely cache the result as long as they know the
 * query input has not changed.
