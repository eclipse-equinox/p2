/**
 * This class represents a simple Java-based query. Clients may subclass and
 * override the {@link #isMatch(Object)} method in order to write simple
 * queries against p2 metadata.
 * <p>
 * Note that hand-written queries cannot be optimized for queryables containing
 * indices, or for remote queryables. In general you should use one of the pre-defined
 * queries found in {@link QueryUtil} if possible, to obtain queries optimized for indexing and
 * remote execution. This class is intended for simple queries against small data
 * sources where indexed lookup and remote query execution are not needed.
 * </p>
 * @deprecated If possible, use one of the predefined queries in {@link QueryUtil} 
 * or use the {@link QueryUtil#createMatchQuery(String, Object...)}
 * to create a custom expression based query. If the query cannot be expressed using
 * the p2QL, then use a predefined or custom expression query as a first filter
 * (in worst case, use {@link QueryUtil#createIUAnyQuery()}) and then provide further filtering
 * like so:<pre>
 * for(iter = queryable.query(someExpressionQuery).iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
 *   // do your match here
 * }</pre>
