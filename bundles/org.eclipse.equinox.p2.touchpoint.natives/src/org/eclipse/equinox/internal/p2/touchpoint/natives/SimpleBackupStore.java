/**
 * Stores files by moving them to a uniquely named temporary directory.
 * 
 * TheBackupStore remembers filenames and can recreate them in their original
 * location.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3> The user of this class should instantiate the BackupStore with
 * some prefix that is meaningful to a human. Uniqueness is obtained without the
 * prefix - the prefix is used to be able to differentiate between different
 * backup directories by a human (in case of crashes etc).
 *
 * If instantiated with a directory this directory will be used to store the
 * backup root directory. If this directory is null, the users home directory is
 * used by default.
 *
 * Once instantiated, use the {@link #backup(File)} and
 * {@link #backupDirectory(File)} methods to move files to backup instead of
 * deleting them. A file that is backed up should not be deleted - it is simply
 * moved out of the way. Use {@link #backupCopy(File)} to move the file out of
 * harms way, but keep a copy of it in the original location. The methods
 * {@link #backupAll(File)} and {@link #backupCopyAll(File)} backs up an entire
 * structure.
 *
 * When backup is finished - the user should either call {@link #restore()} to
 * put all of the files back, or call {@link #discard()} to remove all of the
 * backed up "copies".
 *
 * If {@link #restore()} or {@link #discard()} is not called the backup files
 * will never be deleted.
 *
 * The backup store does not synchronize directories - actions that write new
 * files are responsible for removing them. Overwriting existing files should be
 * done by first backing up the file, and then creating a new file. Modifying a
 * file, should be done by using {@link #backupCopy(File)} or first making a
 * copy, then backing up the original, and then renaming the copy.
 *
 * <h3>Read Only and Permissions</h3> Directories that are read only (to current
 * user) can not be backed up. Backup is performed using
 * {@link File#renameTo(File)} and handling of permissions is operating system
 * dependent. It is expected that a Un*x type system retains the permissions as
 * a file is moved to the backup store and later gets restored. Backup
 * directories are created as they are needed and will (at least on Un*x)
 * inherit the permissions from its parent directory.
 *
 * If a rename can not be performed, the backup store will make a copy and
 * delete the original file. This makes it possible to backup and restore across
 * volume boundaries.
 *
 * When restoring directories they will be created with permissions in a
 * platform specific way (on UN*IX they will inherit the permissions of the
 * parent directory).
 *
 * <h3>Checkpointing</h3> Checkpointing (i.e. to be able to rollback to a
 * particular point) can be implemented by using multiple instances of
 * BackupStore. The client code will need to remember the individual order among
 * the backup stores.
 *
 * <h3>Restartability</h3> Not implemented - it is possible to obtain the name
 * of the backup directories, so manual restore is possible after a crash. An
 * idea is to add persistence to a file, and be able to read it back in again.
 *
 * <h3>A note about exceptions</h3> In general {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 * is thrown when attempting an operation that is considered "wrong use", and an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} or subclass thereof is thrown on an overall
 * wrong use of BackupStore (i.e. attempt to backup when store has been
 * restored). Some cases of "wrong use" can not be differentiated from I/O
 * errors (like a "file not found" as this could be caused by an entire disk
 * disappearing - in these case an {@link IOException} is thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Note</h3> The backup root directory will contain folders
 * that reflects file system roots. These are encoded using "_" for the UNI*X
 * root directory, "__" for a Windows network mounted directory, and single
 * "drive letter" folders corresponding to Windows drive letters. Typically, on
 * UN*X there will only be a "_" directory in the backup root, and on windows
 * there will typically be a single directory called "C".
