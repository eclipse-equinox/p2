 * The engine is a service that naively performs a set of requested changes to a provisioned

 * crafted a valid provisioning plan for the engine to perform, typically by using a planner
 * service.
 * <p>
 * The engine operates by executing a series of installation phases. The client can
 * customize the set of phases that are executed, or else the engine will execute
 * a default set of phases. During each phase the changes described by the provisioning
 * plan are performed against the profile being provisioned.
